# Computer Science - Definitions ðŸ“š

Sure, here are the definitions and explanations in alphabetical order:

1. **Abstraction**: Breaking down a complex problem into multiple smaller problems which are easier to solve. Often involves ignoring details which are irrelevant to simplify a complex problem.

2. **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.

3. **Analogue**: Continuous form of data.

4. **API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications.

5. **Array**: A data structure that stores a collection of items, typically of the same type, in contiguous memory locations.

6. **Big O Notation**: A mathematical notation used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of its input size.

7. **Boolean**: A data type that can have one of two values, typically denoted as true or false.

8. **Cloud Computing**: Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, over the internet (the cloud). Examples are One Drive, Google Drive or iCloud.

9. **Compiler**: A program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.

10. **Conditional Statement**: A programming construct that performs different actions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false.

11. **Database**: An organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

12. **Debugger**: A tool used by programmers to identify and fix errors, or bugs, in their code.

13. **Decomposition**: Decomposition is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller, more manageable parts or components. By breaking down a problem into smaller pieces, each piece can be understood, analysed, and solved independently, making the overall problem more tractable.

14. **Decryption**: The process of converting encrypted data back into its original form.

15. **Encryption**: The process of converting data into a form that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized users.

16. **Function**: A named section of a program that performs a specific task. It is reusable and can be called from different parts of the program.

17. **GUI Testing**: Testing the Graphical User Interface of a software application to ensure it meets usability and functionality requirements.

18. **Heuristics**: Heuristics are problem-solving strategies or rules of thumb that are used to make quick and efficient decisions or solve problems, often when faced with incomplete information or uncertainty. In computer science, heuristics are commonly used in algorithms and problem-solving techniques to guide the search for solutions in situations where finding an optimal solution is impractical or impossible. Heuristics are designed to provide a "good enough" solution in a reasonable amount of time, even if it may not be the best possible solution.

19. **Loop**: A control flow statement for executing a block of code repeatedly.

20. **Moore's Law**: States that the number of transistors that can be placed on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to a doubling of computing power and performance at roughly the same cost.

21. **Network**: A group of interconnected computers or devices that can communicate with each other.

22. **Operating System**: Software that manages computer hardware and provides common services for computer programs.

23. **Protocol**: A set of rules, procedures, or conventions that govern the communication and interaction between two or more entities in a networked environment. Protocols define the format, sequence, and timing of data exchange between devices.

24. **Pseudocode**: Simplified programming language used to show the function of an algorithm.

25. **Ransomware**: Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system or encrypt the data stored on it until a ransom is paid. Once a device is infected with ransomware, the malware typically encrypts files or locks the entire system, making it inaccessible to the user.

26. **Registers**: Registers are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used to temporarily store data. They play a crucial role in the fetch-decode-execute cycle of a computer's instruction execution process.

27. **Recursion**: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

28. **Stakeholder**: Someone who is affected by or has an interest in a particular situation.

29. **The Internet**: A global network of interconnected computers and devices that use standardized communication protocols to exchange data and information. It consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks linked together to facilitate communication, collaboration, and access to resources and services worldwide.

30. **The World Wide Web**: A system of interconnected web pages and digital resources that are accessible over the Internet. It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and has since become a fundamental component of the Internet. The Web uses hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) to transmit data and hyperlinks to navigate between web pages.

31. **Variable**: A symbolic name given to a value that can be changed during the execution of a program.

32. **Virtualization**: The process of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a virtual machine.

33. **Web Browser**: A web browser is a software application used to access and navigate the World Wide Web. It allows users to view web pages, interact with web content, and access online services and resources. Web browsers interpret and render HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript, and other web technologies to display web pages in a graphical user interface.
